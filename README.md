# Quick palaeographer

This tool is based on OpenSeadragon and Annotorious, and is intended to be used to images of manuscripts. Use SHIFT-click to draw bounding boxes, and tag glyphs. Then, open the annotation sidebar to see all your annotations. They are listed in Sanskrit alphabetical order.

This tool was created as part of the [TEST project](https://tst.hypotheses.org/), funded by the research program FRAL 2018 (ANR & DFG). The manuscript image in the demonstration is courtesy of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.
